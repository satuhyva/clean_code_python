# CLEAN CODE PYTHON

I am reading a book about clean code in python.
In this repository you can find notes that I have taken while reading the book.
The notes are in folder "learning" and each subject is in a separate file of its own.
I also plan to start making some little projects to try out what I have learned.
The projects will be placed in the "projects" folder.
